This week, Zac & Will invited me to join a meeting with their main investor, which I accepted as an exciting insight into the "behind the scenes" of the business. I've always been curious about creating my own company, but the funding and business strategy aspect is what scares me the most, so this was an excellent opportunity to challenge those fears. 

It was a very interesting experience, I would imagine that every investor has a different strategy and meeting style, but this was certainly less scary than I imagined. It began with recapping the takeaways and notes from their last meeting and addressing any of those outstanding concerns. Then Will & Zac gave an update on their business, cash flow and future raising ambitions. Finally, it was my chance to explain my role on the team, provide a brief showcase of the application and answer any technical questions they had. 

This experience highlighted the benefit and value the investors provide to Omni. They are focused on achieving the greatest return on their investment and they care about how the business runs but also creating new opportunities. Throughout the meeting, resources were shared, potential meetings were discussed and potential leads were provided. I am certainly more confident that I could address any questions or concerns an investor asked of me, but I believe I still have much to develop in my planning skills. Will & Zac's excellent organisation is what enabled that meeting to run so smoothly and provide the most value to them while building confidence from their investor, so I believe this will be a valuable skill to develop if I want to start a business.
