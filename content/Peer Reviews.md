## Christian Saniel
Christian, I love the use of Milanote for your portfolio this year; the flexible layout, including images and general layout, is a joy to use and feels like something you've crafted over the year. 

Reading through your reflections, I find myself relating to your experiences a lot, going through the highs and lows of the year, balancing project work and difficult third-year classes, and finally understanding the process of machine learning. You gave deep personal reflections on your experiences, and your learnings felt genuine. 

If I could make one recommendation to you, it would be to write more! I would love to read more about your progress with fireball detection, and getting to see some of the code you wrote for it would have been fascinating.  

I look forward to seeing what you achieve next!

## Pia Donovan 
Pia, I've enjoyed reading your portfolio for this year, it's fascinating to read about your work in financial mathematics as it's a field I'm completely unfamiliar with. Your reflections are thorough and deeply reflective; it seems like you've grown a lot this year in project planning, coding and your ambitions. 

I appreciate your collection of project resources; it's great to see the wide amount of research and datasets you've used this year alongside your project timeline. I would love to see the inclusion of some of your interim results or progress in the code to get greater context for your learnings. Despite this, it's still evident that you've spent much time reflecting on how each experience has shaped you this year and how it will benefit your future aspirations. 

Thank you for sharing your portfolio with me, and best of luck in your workforce position next year!

## Jaxson Brown
Jaxson, you've crafted a well-organised, insightful and honest portfolio this year, showcasing your achievements and detailing your growth. I especially appreciate how you've organised and tracked your evidence/artefacts; they provided valuable context and explanations for your overall project.

Your reflections are very personal and honest, I think you've done a great job explaining the situation and your learnings for each experience, especially in regards to the non-technical skills you've learnt like not being too hard on yourself. Even when your project is a success, you're able to break down what caused the success, which is a skill you shouldn't take for granted. 

Honestly, I find it hard to give any constructive criticisms to your portfolio, I believe it is a perfect example of how to showcase your work and growth this year. I can't wait to see what you do next!

## Gabriel Gatchalian
Gabriel, you've kept a detailed portfolio of your work this year and provided interesting artefacts that you have contributed to your project. I appreciate the cohesive story told through your reflections and I feel like I was working alongside you as I was reading them. 

The consistency of your reflections throughout the year is an achievement and demonstrates your growth in technical skills. I would have loved to read more about your non-technical skills. You touched on them a bit in your reflection for the midyear presentation, but I'm sure you've done even more throughout the year. The tracking of all your literature and project resources is really helpful; it could be even better if you reference these pieces within the reflection themselves.  

Overall, you've reflected well on your project this year and I'm excited to see the end result at the showcase.

## Evelyn Innes
Evie, your portfolio was a pleasure to read again this year and seeing your growth from last year. It's exciting to hear about all the activities you've done this year, and I get a true sense of your learning process, especially in the reflections that focus on your scientific work. 

Your writings highlight your positivity and ability to take challenges head-on, like the sustainability challenge you discussed in depth. When I read over your self-reflection, I was surprised to see only competent and developing marked off. As an outsider, I feel like you've marked yourself too critically, especially given all you've achieved in such a short time span, and your supervisors seem to agree as well. 

If I were to give feedback on the reflections, I think the only improvement you could have made this year was to include more artefacts. I remember you had some amazing ones last year, and I'm sure you've taken some great snapshots as your work progressed this year, so show them off!
