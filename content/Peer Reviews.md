## Christian Saniel
Christian, I love the use of Milanote for your portfolio this year; the flexible layout, including images and general layout, is a joy to use and feels like something you've crafted over the year. 

Reading through your reflections, I find myself relating to your experiences a lot, going through the highs and lows of the year, balancing project work and difficult third-year classes, and finally understanding the process of machine learning. You gave deep personal reflections on your experiences, and your learnings felt genuine. 

If I could make one recommendation to you, it would be to write more! I would love to read more about your progress with fireball detection, and getting to see some of the code you wrote for it would have been fascinating.  

I look forward to seeing what you achieve next!
