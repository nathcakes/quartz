On 23 August we had a planning session to determine deadlines and scope out the work that needs to be done until the end of the year. Given the deadline for my NPSC project and even with the extended deadline for the customer of 1 November, I believe I could not deliver a product that I'm happy with in time. 

Although it was possible to deliver a working app in time, I could not meet the projected timeline to deliver an excellent user interface with the new features requested and update our backend to meet the customer's requirements. 

This was a hard decision as it had been my decision to implement the new framework, and I was excited to showcase the benefits to Omni. I appreciate that I've still learned a lot this year, not only with Kotlin Multiplatform but also in other areas of software engineering, such as project management, understanding users, and creating user designs. I believe it won't overwhelmingly impact my NPSC project as I can still talk about my work this year to make the application and share some of my Kotlin code. It also gives me a great chance to reflect on what went wrong in my planning process and the importance of staying flexible.
