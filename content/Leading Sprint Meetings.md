When I started at Omni Biotech last August, there was no formal development structure. While I was the only developer, this was workable, but as more developers joined the team, it was important to create a structure for releases, updates and prioritising features. Due to my prior experience with agile development and its popularity with developers (Omonije, 2024), I decided to develop a simple scrum-inspired sprint for our team. Creating the documentation and schedule was simple; however, running these meetings was challenging.



Writing this weekly update and discussing it in the meeting was very beneficial as it allowed us to celebrate our successes and motivate each other to continue progressing. It was also beneficial for my reflection journal as it was easy to review my work for the year and select the largest projects and my learnings from each week.
